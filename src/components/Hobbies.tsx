/*
Reading
I love reading and gaining a wider perspective on the world around. 
I am especially fond of anthropology, sociology, politics and 
light novels. Uncovering previously-unknown patterns and discovering new societal structured
gives me euphoria, like solving a large puzzle.

Video games
In my free time I also indulge in some videogames. My favourites are Cyberpunk 2077, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,
Elden Ring and Terraria. Video games gives me an experience and stories that transcend the norm. Compelling videogame
stories pull us into the world and make us feel emotions beyond the screen.

Engineering
Engineers are like modern-day wizards. Arthur C. Clarke once said that
'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic'. 
I fell in love with seeing the magic of coding and engineering, seeing my projects
come to life


Exercise
On top of the health benefits, weightlifting and martial arts is a way to expel all my energy, allowing me to stay in tune with my body and maximize its
capability.
